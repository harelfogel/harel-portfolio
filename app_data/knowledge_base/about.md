# About Harel

Full Stack Engineer who thrives on building systems that handle real-world scale. I care about clean architecture, thoughtful abstractions, and shipping things that work reliably under pressure.

## Engineering Philosophy
I believe great software comes from understanding the problem deeply before writing code. I favor simple, composable designs over clever abstractions — and I'm not afraid to refactor when the requirements evolve. I treat infrastructure as a first-class concern, not an afterthought.

## Core Strengths
- **Distributed Systems**: Designed and built high-throughput click pacing infrastructure processing millions of daily events with atomic batching and concurrent dispatch.
- **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Owned AWS infrastructure end-to-end — ECS Fargate deployments, CI/CD pipelines, DynamoDB data modeling, SQS-based event processing.
- **High-Scale Backend**: Built production services with NestJS and FastAPI that handle heavy traffic with consistent performance and reliability.
- **Full Stack Delivery**: Comfortable across the entire stack — from React frontends to PostgreSQL schema design to Docker containerization and deployment.

## What Drives Me
I'm drawn to hard problems with real constraints: concurrency, throughput, data consistency. I find satisfaction in building systems that are not just functional but operationally excellent — easy to monitor, debug, and scale. Outside of engineering, I bring the same discipline from my military leadership background to team collaboration and project delivery.
